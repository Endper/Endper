- 👋 Hi, I’m Endper and I'm most known as a game developer.
- 👀 I’m a programmer since Q2 of 2020.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Godot, C++, and doing some AI engineering.
- 💞️ I'm happy to chat with you about any of my projects.
- 📫 If you want to see some of the games that I've made, go to my GameJolt page: https://gamejolt.com/@Endper or itch.io page: https://endperxd.itch.io/.
- 💻 Besides programming I do digital, traditional, and pixel art, watching YouTube, and sleeping.
